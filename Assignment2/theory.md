1)What is NPM?
It is the standared repository for all the packages.It works as package manager.

2)What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?
Parcel and Webpack are both bundlers for web applications.
A bundler is a tool that bundles our app, packages our app so that it can be shipped to production. 

3)What is .parcel-cache?
stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have 
to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode. 
Parcel caches code all the time.
When we run the application, a build is created which takes some time in ms.
If we make any code changes and save the application, another build will be triggered which might take even less time than
the previous build.
This reduction of time is due to parcel cache.
Parcel immediately loads the code from the cache every time there is a subsequent build.
On the very first build parcel creates a folder .parcelcache where it stores the caches in binary codeformat.
Parcel gives faster build, faster developer experience because of caching.

4)What is npx?
npx is package runner tool . it will execute the package.

5)What is difference between dependencies vs devDependencies?
Packages listed under dependencies are essential for the application to run in production. These are the packages your application needs to function properly.
Packages listed under devDependencies are only necessary for the development and testing phases of your application. They are not required in the production environment.

6)What is Tree Shaking?
Tree shaking is a process of removing the unwanted code that we do not use while developing the application.
In computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code.

7)What is Hot Module Replacement?
It means that parcel will keep a track of all the files which you are updating.
There is File Watcher Algorithm (written in C++). It keeps track of all the files which are changing realtime and it
tells the server to reload. These are all done by PARCEL

8)List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.
-Hot Module Replacement (HMR):It means that parcel will keep a track of all the files which you are updating.
-Lazy dev builds:In development, Parcel can defer building files until they are requested in the browser. This means you only need to wait for the page you're actually working on to build! If your project has many entries or code split points, this can massively reduce dev server startup time.
-Tree shaking:Tree shaking is a process of removing the unwanted code that we do not use while developing the application.
In computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code.
-Minify Code:Parcel includes minifiers for JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and SVG out of the box! Just run parcel build index.html, and your whole application will be built and optimized automatically.
-Image Optimization:Parcel supports resizing, converting, and optimizing images! Just pass query parameters for the format and size you need when referencing the image file in your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. and Parcel will take care of the conversion and optimization process.

9)What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?
 .gitignore file is a plain text file in a Git repository that specifies which files and directories to ignore and not track in version control. This is useful for excluding files that are not necessary to be tracked by Git, such as build outputs, temporary files, and sensitive information.

10)What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
In package. json we have information about generic version of installed packages whereas in package.lock.json we have
information about the specific or exact version of installed packages.
Package.json file is a configuration for NPM. Whatever packages our project needs, we install those packages using npm install <packageName>.
Once package installation is complete, their versions andconfiguration related information is stored as dependencies inside package.json file.
Package-lock.json locks the exact version of packages being used in the project.

11)Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
The package-lock.json file is automatically generated by npm when dependencies are installed in project.
It locks the versions of the installed packages to ensure that the same versions are used whenever the project is installed on another machine or in another environment.
Modifying package-lock.json manually can lead to inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and other issues. It is best to rely on npm's automated tools to manage this file to ensure that your project's dependencies remain consistent, secure, and efficient.

12)What is node_modules? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
Which gets installed is like a database for the npm.Every dependency in node_module will have its package.json.
Node modules are very heavy so we should always put this in git ignore.

13)What is the dist folder?
It keeps the files minified for us.When bundler builds the app, the build goes into a folder called dist.
The `/dist` folder contains the minimized and optimised version the source code.
Along with the minified code, the /dist folder also comprises of all the compiled modules that may or may not be used with
other systems.

14)What is browserlists?
Browserslist is a tool that specifies which browsers should be supported/compatible in your frontend app.
It makes our code compatible for a lot of browsers.

15)Read about dif bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel
Vite is a modern front-end build tool.It provides a development server with hot module replacement (HMR) and a build command to bundle the project for production.
Webpack is a powerful and flexible bundler that has been the industry standard for many years. It can handle a wide variety of assets and has a rich ecosystem of plugins and loaders.
Parcel is a zero-configuration bundler that focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It automatically handles common bundling needs without requiring a detailed configuration file.

16)Read about: ^ - caret and ~ - tilda
the caret (^) and tilde (~) are used in package.json to specify version ranges for dependencies. These symbols help manage and control which versions of a package are acceptable to install, allowing for flexibility while ensuring compatibility.

17)Read about Script types in html
-Default JavaScript (text/javascript)
-ES6 Module (type="module")
-Deferred Execution (defer)
-Asynchronous Execution (async)
-Inline JSON (type="application/json")
-Other Scripting Languages
