React Hooks provide a powerful and flexible way to use state, lifecycle methods, and other features in functional components. They help to write cleaner, more readable, and more maintainable React code without relying on class components.

4)Why do we need a useState Hook?
It is used to create state variable .It maintains the state of your application or it maintains the state of your component.
The useState hook is a fundamental hook in React that allows functional components to have their own state.
The useState hook is essential for enabling state management in functional components, making code simpler, more concise, and easier to maintain. It is a core part of React's modern approach to building components and managing state, promoting better practices and enhancing the overall development experience.
